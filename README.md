## Serving the Application Files

While AngularJS is client-side-only technology and it's possible to create AngularJS webapps that
don't require a backend server at all, we recommend serving the project files using a local
web server during development to avoid issues with security restrictions (sandbox) in browsers. The
sandbox implementation varies between browsers, but quite often prevents things like cookies, xhr,
etc to function properly when an html page is opened via `file://` scheme instead of `http://`.

### Running the App during Development

The angular-seed project comes pre-configured with a local development web server. It is a node.js
tool called [http-server][http-server].  You can install http-server globally:

```
npm install -g live-server
```

Then you can start your own development web server to serve static files from a folder by running:

```
cd app
live-server
```

Alternatively, you can choose to configure your own webserver, such as apache or nginx. Just
configure your server to serve the files under the `app/` directory.
